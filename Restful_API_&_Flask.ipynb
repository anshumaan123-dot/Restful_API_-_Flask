        "Q1.  What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST architecture, allowing systems to communicate over HTTP in a stateless, scalable, and standardized way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "- An API specification is a detailed, formal description of how an API works — what it does, what inputs it expects, what outputs it provides, and how developers should interact with it.\n",
        "- It acts as a contract between the API provider and API consumer, ensuring both sides understand how to communicate correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "- Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework used for building web applications and RESTful APIs. It’s part of the microframework category, meaning it comes with the bare minimum to get a web app up and running, but is highly extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "- Routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs (web addresses) to functions (called view functions) that handle web requests and return responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "- Flask(__name__): Creates the Flask app.\n",
        "- @app.route('/'): Sets up the route for the home page (root URL).\n",
        "- home(): The function that runs when the route is visited.\n",
        "- app.run(debug=True): Starts the development server with debug mode on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "1. GET – Retrieve a user's data\n",
        "2. POST – Create a new user\n",
        "3. PUT – Update an entire user record\n",
        "4. PATCH – Update part of the user record\n",
        "5. DELETE – Remove a user\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "- The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL to a specific function — known as a view function. It defines the route (path) on which the application should respond, and what logic should be executed when that route is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "- The **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods are used to communicate with a server, but they serve different purposes and behave differently. The **GET** method is used to **retrieve data** from a server. It appends the data to the URL as query parameters, making it visible in the browser and easily shareable or cached. GET requests are **idempotent** and **safe**, meaning they do not alter the server's state. On the other hand, the **POST** method is used to **send data** to the server to create or update a resource. The data is included in the **body of the request**, making it more secure for sensitive information. Unlike GET, POST can **modify server state**, and its requests are **not cached or bookmarked** by default. In short, GET is for fetching data, while POST is for submitting data to be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "1. Using abort() for Simple Errors\n",
        "2. Custom Error Handlers\n",
        "3. Handling Validation Errors\n",
        "4. Using Try-Except Blocks\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "- To connect Flask to a SQL database, the most common and powerful approach is using SQLAlchemy, a popular ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Python. It allows you to work with databases using Python classes instead of raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "- Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy — a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) — with Flask applications. It makes it much easier to interact with SQL databases (like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "- Flask Blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into modular components. Think of them as mini-apps within your main app — each handling a specific feature or section of the application.\n",
        "1. Modular code structure - Easier to manage and scale\n",
        "2. Reusability - Can reuse components across projects\n",
        "3. Better collaboration - Multiple devs can work on separate parts\n",
        "4. Cleaner main app file - Keeps app.py minimal and organized\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "- The request object in Flask is used to access data sent by the client (such as a web browser, mobile app, or API consumer) to the server during an HTTP request.\n",
        "- It provides a simple and consistent interface to retrieve form data, query parameters, JSON payloads, headers, files, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "1. Install Flask\n",
        "2. Basic Flask REST API Example\n"

        "\n",
        "Q16.  Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
        "- Flask’s url_for() function is used to build dynamic URLs for routes in your application based on the function names instead of hardcoding URLs.\n",
        "- It ensures your URLs stay consistent and automatically adapt to any route changes, making your code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",

        "1. Available endpoints (URLs),\n",
        "2. HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.),\n",

        "6. Data formats (usually JSON).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "- HTTP status codes are standardized 3-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request. They indicate the result of the request — whether it was successful, caused an error, or requires further action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "- In Flask, you handle POST requests by:\n",
        "1. Defining a route that accepts POST method.\n",
        "2. Extracting data from the request (form, JSON, etc.).\n",
        "3. Processing the data (e.g., saving to a database).\n",

        "- Securing a Flask API is crucial to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure trust in your application. Flask offers several tools and practices to enhance API security.\n",
